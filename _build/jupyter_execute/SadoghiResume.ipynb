    "This project was carried out in Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Iran. The product of this project is in the form of MATLAB coding based on artificial intelligence, which is able to use brain EEG signal to categorize different disease cases. In the form of the developer of the existing algorithms and the implementation of the proposed algorithm, I was engaged in this work in the form of a team of 3 people. Finally, by using existing classification methods and improving their performance, the output of this project reached an acceptable accuracy.\n",

    "This project was carried out in Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Iran. The product of this project is in the form of coding based on artificial intelligence, which is able to prepare hyperspectral images obtained from sensing satellites for segmentation using a pre-processing block and then apply the segmentation method to the image. This pre-processing block based on the noise-resistant Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) method is able to reduce the effect of noisy labels and thus significantly increase the accuracy in the segmentation of different regions in the hyperspectral image.\n",

As a designer of algorithms to identify types of vehicles by merging two views of the vehicle image. In this project, it was done using image processing algorithms, in which the type of car was identified by using two images taken by the camera from two different views of the car. Here, it was necessary to prepare a comprehensive library of images of all types of cars. The performance of the final product was\n",
    "acceptable on all types of cars.\n",

    "**Positioning of users in the cellular network, 2022**\n",
    "The purpose of this project was to locate users based on applied algorithms in this field, which was carried out at Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Mashhad, Iran. This project works based on the power level received from the mobile station in closed environments. The purpose of this project is to help the handoff in the cellular network based on user categories. Based on this,\n",
    "users whose received power level is lower than a provincial limit need to be transferred to another base station for them. In this approach, spectral clustering algorithm was used to classify mobile stations.\n",

    "working on this project and I did only the engineering intelligence part of it. It was written in Python for the core of artificial intelligence and in the form of API and with Flask. An Android application was also prepared for it. Coach performs a set of sports exercises and upload the video to the application, and also add the beginning and end of the movements and the type of exercises. Users choose their desired exercises, perform them and take a video of their exercise with their mobile phone and upload the video to the application. This video related to the user is analyzed and it is given a score based on the correctness of the movements performed. Points are given based on the comparison of this video with the trainer's video. During the processing process, first the key points of body movements are extracted from the instructor's video and then the corresponding points are compared with\n",
    "them from the user's video frames. Finally, based on this comparison, the user's movement is scored.\n",

For example,\n",
    "weighing a camel is a challenge that can be done by processing the image with a camera or by measuring different parts of the body. In this project, it was finally done based on the dimensions of different body parts and by applying regression (SVR with polynomial kernel). By using this application, instead of weighing with a scale and applying stress to the camel, by measuring\n",
