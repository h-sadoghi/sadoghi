    "## Sensor Datasets with Feature Extraction\n",
    "Sensor datasets, recorded by various sensors detecting environmental changes, are crucial for real-time monitoring, decision-making, predictive analysis, and automation.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Types of Sensors\n",
    "*Temperature Sensors*: Measure temperature.\n",
    "*Pressure Sensors*: Detect pressure variations.\n",
    "*Accelerometers and Gyroscopes*: Measure acceleration and orientation.\n",
    "*Proximity and Light Sensors*: Detect object presence and light intensity.\n",
    "*Sound Sensors*: Capture audio signals.\n",
    "*Chemical Sensors*: Monitor environmental changes.\n",

    "### Some Examples of Feature extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Feature Extraction from Text: \n",
    "Feature extraction from text involves converting text data into numerical representations that can be used for machine learning models. One common method is using the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here‚Äôs a simple explanation and Python code to perform TF-IDF feature extraction:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Concepts:\n",
    "*Document*: A piece of text. *Corpus*: A collection of documents. *Term Frequency (TF)*: The frequency of a term ùë° in a document ùëë. *Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)*: Measures how important a term is in the entire corpus.\n",
    "The TF-IDF value increases with the number of times a term appears in a document but is offset by the frequency of the term in the corpus, to adjust for the fact that some words are generally more common than others.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps to Compute TF-IDF:**\n",
    "1-Calculate the Term Frequency (TF) for each term in each document.\n",
    "2-Calculate the Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) for each term.\n",
    "3-Multiply the TF and IDF values to get the TF-IDF score for each term in each document.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### TF-IDF Formula\n",
    "TF-IDF stands for Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency. It is a numerical statistic intended to reflect how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Term Frequency (TF)\n",
    "The term frequency TF(t,d) is the frequency of term t  in document  d.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{TF}(t,d) = \\frac{\\text{Number of times term } t \\text{ appears in document } d}{\\text{Total number of terms in document } d}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)\n",
    "\n",
    "The inverse document frequency IDF(t,D)  measures how important a term is across the entire corpus D .\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{IDF}(t,D) = \\log \\left( \\frac{N}{|\\{d \\in D : t \\in d\\}|} \\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$N\\left(x_i, \\mu_c, \\Sigma_c\\right)=\\frac{1}{(2 \\pi)^{\\frac{n}{2}}\\left|\\Sigma_c\\right|^{\\frac{1}{2}}} \\exp \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\left(x_i-\\mu_c\\right)^T \\Sigma_c^{-1}\\left(x_i-\\mu_c\\right)\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "-  N is the total number of documents in the corpus. Denumerator is the number of documents where the term  t appears (i.e., the document frequency of the term).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### TF-IDF Score\n",
    "The TF-IDF score for a term  t  in a document d is the product of its TF and IDF values.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{TF-IDF}(t,d,D) = \\text{TF}(t,d) \\times \\text{IDF}(t,D)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This formula adjusts the term frequency of a word by how rarely it appears in the entire corpus, emphasizing words that are more unique to specific documents.\n"

    "#### Feature Extraction from Image: \n",
    "\n",
    "**_Feature extraction_** from images involves transforming raw image data into a set of representative features that can be used for analysis or machine learning tasks. Some of its stages include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Preprocessing**\n",
    "   Before extracting features, it's often necessary to preprocess the images to standardize them and remove noise. Common preprocessing steps include resizing, cropping, normalization, and noise reduction.\n",
    "2. **Feature Extraction Techniques**\n",
    "   There are various techniques for extracting features from images. Some popular methods include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- _Histogram of Oriented Gradients ([HOG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram_of_oriented_gradients))_\n",
    "  HOG computes the distribution of gradient orientations in localized portions of an image. It's commonly used for object detection and recognition tasks.\n",
    "- _Scale-Invariant Feature Transform ([SIFT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale-invariant_feature_transform))_\n",
    "  SIFT detects and describes local features in an image that are invariant to scale, rotation, and illumination changes. It's widely used in image matching and object recognition.\n",
    "- Convolutional Neural Networks ([CNNs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network))\n",
    "  CNNs are deep learning models that automatically learn hierarchical features from images. They consist of convolutional layers that extract features at different levels of abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Feature Representation**\n",
    "   Once features are extracted, they need to be represented in a suitable format for analysis or machine learning algorithms. This could involve reshaping them into vectors or matrices.\n",
    "4. **Application**\n",
    "   Extracted features can be used for various tasks such as image classification, object detection, image retrieval, and content-based image retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python Libraries for Image Feature Extraction**\n",
    "Popular Python *libraries for image feature extraction* include `OpenCV, scikit-image, and TensorFlow`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simple example using scikit-image to extract HOG features from an image:"
