**Career Experience**

**Classification of EEG Signal**
This project was carried out in Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Iran. The product of this project is in the form of MATLAB coding based on artificial intelligence, which is able to use brain EEG signal to categorize different disease cases. In the form of the developer of the existing algorithms and the implementation of the proposed algorithm, I was engaged in this work in the form of a team of 3 people. Finally, by using existing classification methods and improving their performance, the output of this project reached an acceptable accuracy.
       
**MRI Image segmentation** 
This project was carried out in Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Iran. The product of this project is in the form of Python coding based on artificial intelligence, which is able to segment the obtained MRI image of the human brain and categorize the types of brain tissue. In this project, this team was responsible for coding and implementing the algorithms, and the final result was the high accuracy of the algorithm compared to the existing ones.

**Hyperspectral Image Segmentation**
This project was carried out in Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Iran. The product of this project is in the form of coding based on artificial intelligence, which is able to prepare hyperspectral images obtained from sensing satellites for segmentation using a pre-processing block and then apply the segmentation method to the image. This pre-processing block based on the noise-resistant Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) method is able to reduce the effect of noisy labels and thus significantly increase the accuracy in the segmentation of different regions in the hyperspectral image.
       
**Interactive wall**
As a senior researcher, Using a 3D camera such as Kinect to obtain 3D images online, plus a processor whose task is to perform image processing algorithms on the obtained images. For example, this system was developed in order to create entertainment for
children, in which the child is interactively engaged in games designed on the wall. One of the existing challenges was determining and estimating the depth of objects, determining the effect of camera tilt on images, and calibrating the camera. The programming language for the artificial intelligence engine was Python, and a software for initial settings and game type determination was C#. Also, the game was written with UNITY. This system can be used for education, language and math education and creating activity
in entertainment for children with autism.

**Facebook and 500px social networks image labeling**
This project was carried out at Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Iran, which has one of the best artificial intelligence groups among Iranian universities. The product of this project is in the form of coding based on artificial intelligence, which is able to label and categorize images based on images collected from Facebook and 500px social networks for applications such as tourist. In this project, the robust spectral clustering method was used to classify the features extracted from the AlexNet deep network, which
significantly increased the accuracy of semantic labeling.

**Traffic scene analysis**
As a designer of algorithms for plural behavior of driver modeling. In this project, the goal was to use artificial intelligence algorithms learning in predicting and modeling the driver's behavior.

**Vehicle Identifier Project Garmsar University, Garmsar, Iran, 2003-2004**
As a designer of algorithms for identifying types of vehicles by fusion of two views of image of vehicle. As a designer of algorithms to identify types of vehicles by merging two views of the vehicle image. In this project, it was done using image processing algorithms, in which the type of car was identified by using two images taken by the camera from two different views of the car. Here, it was necessary to prepare a comprehensive library of images of all types of cars. The performance of the final product was
acceptable on all types of cars.

**Vision Based Tracker Project**
As a senior researcher, in study on different types of vision-based tracker systems.  In this project, tracking based on video and processing its different frames was done in order to track a target in different frames. Artificial intelligence were used in this field.

**Positioning of users in the cellular network, 2022**
The purpose of this project was to locate users based on applied algorithms in this field, which was carried out at Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Mashhad, Iran. This project works based on the power level received from the mobile station in closed environments. The purpose of this project is to help the handoff in the cellular network based on user categories. Based on this,
users whose received power level is lower than a provincial limit need to be transferred to another base station for them. In this approach, spectral clustering algorithm was used to classify mobile stations.

**Coach simulation**
As a Co-researcher, Coach simulation (movement comparison), for Smart Coach, Estonia. A team was
working on this project and I did only the engineering intelligence part of it. It was written in Python for the core of artificial intelligence and in the form of API and with Flask. An Android application was also prepared for it. Coach performs a set of sports exercises and upload the video to the application, and also add the beginning and end of the movements and the type of exercises. Users choose their desired exercises, perform them and take a video of their exercise with their mobile phone and upload the video to the application. This video related to the user is analyzed and it is given a score based on the correctness of the movements performed. Points are given based on the comparison of this video with the trainer's video. During the processing process, first the key points of body movements are extracted from the instructor's video and then the corresponding points are compared with
them from the user's video frames. Finally, based on this comparison, the user's movement is scored.

**Camel GPS Tracker Application (Android), February 2022/ Camel GPS Tracker,
February 2022/ SAREBANYAR App for camel husbandry and management, April 2020**
As a Teammate, This project was performed for Animal Science Research Institute of IRAN (ASRI), Project Management, Camel GPS Tracker and Data Management and weight prediction Application (Android), Machine learning (Camel Weight Estimation),
Link: sarebanyar.asri.ir/login. It was an application for camel data management that has both data management and data registration. The data is recorded in the management panel server, this data includes the number of animals in each farm, the number of males and females, age, etc. This information after aggregation was used for various applications. For example,
weighing a camel is a challenge that can be done by processing the image with a camera or by measuring different parts of the body. In this project, it was finally done based on the dimensions of different body parts and by applying regression (SVR with polynomial kernel). By using this application, instead of weighing with a scale and applying stress to the camel, by measuring
specific parts of the camel's body and entering it into the application, farmers can get the approximate weight of the camel. Also, this application determines the location of the animal based on GPS data.
